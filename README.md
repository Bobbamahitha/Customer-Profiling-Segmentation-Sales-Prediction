***1.Customer Profiling, Segmentation & Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning***

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning approach for analyzing customer behavior and forecasting sales trends using both structured (sales data) and unstructured (customer reviews) data.

**🚀Key Components:**

**Customer Segmentation:** Used clustering algorithms like `K-Means` and `DBSCAN` to segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Applied `VADER` to analyze customer reviews and extract sentiment scores, enhancing customer profiles.

**Sales Prediction Models:** Built regression models including `Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest` to predict sales performance.

**Time-Series Forecasting:** Utilized `ARIMA` and `LSTM models` for short-term and long-term sales trend forecasting.

**🎯Outcome:**

`Identified distinct customer` groups for targeted marketing.

Integrated sentiment scores to `improve prediction accuracy.`

Delivered actionable insights for marketing strategy, inventory planning, and customer retention.
