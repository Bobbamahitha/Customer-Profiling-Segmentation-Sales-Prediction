***1.Customer Profiling, Segmentation & Sales Forecasting using Machine Learning***

This project presents a comprehensive machine learning approach for analyzing customer behavior and forecasting sales trends using both structured (sales data) and unstructured (customer reviews) data.

**ðŸš€Key Components:**

**Customer Segmentation:** Used clustering algorithms like `K-Means` and `DBSCAN` to segment customers based on demographics and purchasing behavior.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Applied `VADER` to analyze customer reviews and extract sentiment scores, enhancing customer profiles.

**Sales Prediction Models:** Built regression models including `Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest` to predict sales performance.

**Time-Series Forecasting:** Utilized `ARIMA` and `LSTM models` for short-term and long-term sales trend forecasting.

**ðŸŽ¯Outcome:**

`Identified distinct customer` groups for targeted marketing.

Integrated sentiment scores to `improve prediction accuracy.`

Delivered actionable insights for marketing strategy, inventory planning, and customer retention.

***2.Research Paper***

**Title: Customer Profiling, Segmentation, and Sales Prediction â€“ Research Publication**

**ðŸ“„Abstract:**

This paper explores data-driven approaches for profiling and segmenting customers using clustering algorithms and sentiment analysis of reviews, followed by sales prediction using regression and time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM). The proposed method improves marketing precision and inventory planning by combining customer behavior insights with sales trend predictions.
